The meetup is scheduled for Wednesday, April 26th from 7:30 PM to 9:40 PM. The registration for the meetup will be opened soon. To stay updated on the registration and get notified quickly, please join the [Cross-Platform Korea Slack community](https://dooboolab.com/joinCPKorea).

We brought in a special speaker for the current month. [Florian Ludot](https://github.com/florianldt) serves as CTO of [Avanssion Inc](https://avanssion.com) and was born and raised in France. At this meetup, he plans to share the know-how accumulated over many years of close collaboration with the development and design teams.

On the day, there will be a presentation on Flutter Application with GetX pattern and networking by group. While networking, you will be able to freely talk, set missions, and contribute to future meetups.
Any activity is irrelevant as long as the mission is to share cross-platform knowledge to community. I would appreciate it if you could confirm with the operator in advance.

## January 2023

From January 25, 2023, the name of the meetup will be changed from React Native Seoul to Cross-Platform Korea.
Since React Native is a cross-platform technology after all, and Flutter and MAUI can also develop services while responding to multiple platforms in a similar way, we saw that there are many opportunities to broaden our knowledge and communicate.

I hope that future meetups will be more beneficial and interesting to all of you.

## [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ko-KR/crossplatformkorea/events/290799845)
