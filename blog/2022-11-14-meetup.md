Hello 👋
[November 30 meetup application](https://www.meetup.com/ko-KR/crossplatformkorea/events/289741685) is now applicable.

As announced last time, this meetup will select a topic for each group and make a presentation. The group that provides the most highly rated content will receive a prize worth 500,000 won ($376).

For the prize money, each leader can claim directly to our [community sponsored organization](https://opencollective.com/dooboolab-community). It is believed that each leader will reasonably spend the prize money with the members, but you can decide freely :)

For details, please check the [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/ko-KR/crossplatformkorea/events/289741685).

Then see you at the meetup 🙇🏻
